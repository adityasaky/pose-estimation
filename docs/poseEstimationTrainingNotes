Note on training
================
Training data is point cloud files named as x.pcd.

All PCD data files are captures 100 msecs apart. Choose every 10th file for training 
so they are 1 second apart, else they will look too close/similar to each other.
ex. if PCD files are numbered 1 - 600, chose files 1, 10, 20, 30 ... 600 (about 60 files).
Let us call this the training source files. 

Generate training target files in steps :

1) For each file in the training source, apply rotations using a rotation matrix in steps 
and generate rotated images (in memory). Let us choose angles from 0 thru 60 degress in 
steps of 3 (21 angle positions)

2) For each rotated image from (1) above, of each file in the training source, apply 
translations from 0 to 10 meters in steps of 2 (6 step positions) and generate the training 
target files. Store this as a PCD file as per naming convention below.

Name the target files as follows : <PCD_number>_<angle>_<step>.pcd 
ex. the training source file 50.pcd would have a training target file
50_20_5.pcd is for 20 degree rotation and 5 meters translation and
50_0_5.pcd is for no rotation but a translation of 5 meters
50_0_0.pcd is for no rotation and no translation ie. the same as source

Alternately (recommended) you can combine (1) and (2) above by using pre-created transformation
matrices; a single matrix generated by multiplying the rotation and translation matrix
as described below

Store the transformation matrices as pickle files tm(r, t) = tm(r) * tm(t) where 
tm(r) is the rotation matrix and tm(t) is the translation matrix. Alternately you 
could generate 125 different transformation matrices upfront and store them accordingly

Name the transformation matrices pickle files as tm_<r>_<n>.pkl, where 
r is the rotation applied ex 0 thru 60 in steps of 3
m is the translation applied ex 0 thru 10 in steps of 2
tm_9_6.pkl is the transformation matrix that can generate a rotation of 9 degrees
and a translation of 6 meters when applied to any source image

So for every PCD file choosen for training, you will generate 126 target files
(21 rotation angles and 6 translation steps). However it is really 125 files 
as x_0_0.pcd is the same as x.pcd

So if we have a set of 600 files, you would end up with 
600 * 21 * 6 = 75600 files !

Mandatory : In your code keep start_angle, stop_angle and steps configurable
Likewise with start_translation, end_translations, translation_step as configurable;
to start with these can be 0-60-3 and 0-10-2 respectively.

When training we would use the following pairs {i1, i1(r, t), tm(r, t)}
tm(r, t) is the transformationMatrix with rotation r and translation t, and
where i1(r, t) is i1 after transformationMatrix(r, t) has been applied to it
